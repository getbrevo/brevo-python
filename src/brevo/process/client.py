        Retrieves a list of background processes from your Brevo account with filtering and pagination.

        **Use this to:**
        - Monitor background process activity and status
        - Track long-running operations and tasks
        - Find process IDs for detailed status checking
        - Review process history and performance
        - Identify failed or stuck processes for troubleshooting

        **Key information returned:**
        - Process details (ID, name, type, status)
        - Process creation and completion timestamps
        - Process progress and completion status
        - Error information for failed processes
        - Process result data and download links

        **Important considerations:**
        - Background processes handle long-running operations like imports and exports
        - Process status indicates current state (queued, processing, completed, failed, cancelled)
        - Export processes provide download URLs when completed
        - Failed processes include error messages for troubleshooting
        - Use pagination for accounts with many historical processes
        - Sort options available for creation order (ascending or descending)
        - Different process types handle specific operations (imports, exports, calculations)

        Parameters
        ----------
        limit : typing.Optional[int]
            Number limitation for the result returned

        offset : typing.Optional[int]
            Beginning point in the list to retrieve from.

        sort : typing.Optional[GetProcessesRequestSort]
            Sort the results in the ascending/descending order of record creation.
            Default order is **descending** if `sort` is not passed

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
            Request-specific configuration.

        Returns
        -------
        GetProcessesResponse
            Background processes retrieved successfully

        **Use this to:**
        - Get detailed status of a specific process
        - Monitor process progress and completion
        - Download results from completed export processes
        - Check error details for failed processes
        - Track process execution times

        **Key information returned:**
        - Complete process details and status
        - Import/export statistics and results
        - Error information for troubleshooting
        - Download URLs for export processes
        - Process timing and performance data

        **Important considerations:**
        - Process ID must exist in your account
